## Welcome to my Home

**Things you'll need to know**
 
 
 The wifi network is 
 
 I'm sorry.
 
 for the password, check the crossstitch! 
 
 
 

 
 Empty the drain trap after you shower so it'll drain for the next person.
 
 When turning on and off the bathtub faucets, handle them gently, the seals are weak.
 
 Please don't use the back, main-floor door. Its threshold is not load-bearing.
 
 Don't leave anything you care about unattended in the back yard, and lock the doors, even if you're only leaving for a moment.
 
 Please don't tag my home's location on social media.
 
 
 **Things that might come in handy**
 
 Dishes and silverware are in the storage cabinets/drawers in the sink room.
 
 I should have everything you need out for you, but if I failed, the pantry with a solid door holds teas, bathtowels, dish towels, dishcloths, and extra-extra toilet paper.
 
 Bring your own coffee. (If I kept it in stock, it would go stale.) If you prefer, there is a nice coffeeshop 1 block north and 1.5 blocks west.
 
 Spare bike helmets are in the basement, on the shelf against the north wall. Lubes and other basics are there too.
 
 To do laundry, plan ahead to give your clothes time to line-dry. Turn the water sources full on when you go to start the machine, and turn the water sources full off when the cycle finishes. If the machine falls off its stand, ask for help. 
 
 To use the stove or oven, plug in the gray cord and turn on the gas. As soon as you are done needing heat, turn off the gas and unplug the cord immediately.
 
 Don't lick the roses in the summer months, they receive a weekly fungicide application until September.
 
 When harvesting herbs, leave enough behind to keep growing. Niether the rhubarb nor the asparagus can be harvested in 2016.
 
 Recyclables can all be placed in the same cardboard box under the sink.

 **In Summary**
 
 If it looks like it's about to break, it is, treat it gently.
 
 On the bright side, you will wake up to waffles.
 
 I was asked what I'd appreciate as hostess gifts, and the answer is YOUR SMILING FACES, and possibly fresh fruit. For those who insist, [here][] are some inspirations.
