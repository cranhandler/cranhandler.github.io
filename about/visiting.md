##Welcome to my Home
 
 **Things you'll need to know**
 
 
 The wifi network is 
 
 I'm sorry.
 
 for the password, check the crossstitch! 
 
 
 
 Bring your own coffee. (If I kept it in stock, it would go stale.) 
 
 Empty the drain trap after you shower so it'll drain for the next person.
 
 Please don't use the back, main-floor door. Its threshold is not load-bearing.
 
 Don't leave anything you care about unattended in the back yard, and lock the doors, even if you're only leaving for a moment.
 
 Please don't tag my home's location on social media.
 
 
 **Things that might come in handy**
 
 Dishes and silverware are in the storage cabinets/drawers in the sink room.
 
 I should have everything you need out for you, but if I failed, the pantry with a solid door holds teas, bathtowels, dish towels, dishcloths, and extra-extra toilet paper.
 
 Spare bike helmets are in the basement, on the shelf against the north wall. Lubes and other basics are there too.
 
 To do laundry, plan ahead to give your clothes time to line-dry. Turn the water sources full on when you go to start the machine, and turn the water sources full off when the cycle finishes. If the machine falls off its stand, ask for help. 
 
 To use the stove or oven, plug in the gray cord and turn on the gas. As soon as you are done needing heat, turn off the gas and unplug the cord immediately.
 
 Don't lick the roses in the summer months, they receive a weekly fungicide application until September.
 
 When harvesting herbs, leave enough behind to keep growing.
 
 Recyclables can all be placed in the same cardboard box under the sink.
 
 **Emergency Contacts**
 
 Police Emergency line: 911
 
 Police non-emergency line: (314) 444-2500
 
 You are in district 3. 
 
 
 
 **In Summary**
 
 If it looks like it's about to break, it is. I'm sorry I live in a hovel---I know it and I'm working on fixing it. 
 
 On the bright side, you will wake up to waffles.
