My family farm upbringing guided my problem-solving drive to precision agriculture. From my BS in Biological Systems and Agricultural Engineering at the [University of Minnesota][] to my MS in Biological Systems Engineering at the [University of Nebraska][] under [Slava Adamchuk][], I have attempted to understand spatial variability in soils to produce better crop yields with less waste. 

My [master's thesis][] focuses on site specific application of lime to improve nutrient uptake, and blogs produced for FamilyFarms Group have focused on common areas I see for improvement in production agriculture ([yield data cleaning][] and [experimental design][]). 

Here's my [conference call wall][] for training webinar access.
