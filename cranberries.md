A view from the shop of the south beds. The closest has already been harvested, the further ones are waiting.

This bed has been flooded. The berries' density is similar to apples, so they strain the vines to float.

Once flooded, beaters knock the berries off the vines.

When berries were packed on-farm, sorters on-farm eliminated poor quality berries. "Only the best Ben Lear berries bounce." This sorting now happens at the processing facility.
