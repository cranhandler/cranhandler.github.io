Come dance with friends and neighbors! A mix of fun, simple, American folk dances will be taught and called. We had a wonderful time last year and we'd love if you joined us for some fun the day after Thanksgiving. This will be the third dance in our "every-so-often" series.

who: Everyone is welcome. No partner needed, no experience needed.
when: 6:30pm to 8:30pm, Friday Nov 29
where: Stone Lake Lion's Hall
wear: smooth soled shoes, comfortable clothes. Twirly skirts are fun but not required.
music: the Second Wind String Band 
how much: free. We'll have a tip jar for the Lions and for the Band
why: it'll be fun!
