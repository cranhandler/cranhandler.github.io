title: exploration of pet peeve figures

A facebook friend made a cool post, asking what figures or figure combos are the pet peeves of choreographers or other dancers. I wanted to see how common some of these beloathÃ©d figures were, so I tried some object-level observation with [contradb.com][]. For reference, today (August 7, 2018), contradb.com has 468 public dances. When I'm signed in (so my private dances appear), I have 492 available. 

Post texts will be left anonymous unless a poster wants their comment attributed; post text will be taken down upon request; this "blog post" might not remain up ad infinitum. 

> what are you contra choreography pet peeves? This can be anything from "asdf this feels SO LOUSY" (a BIG one of mine is courtesy turn to circle L) or "huh, I kinda wish they'd done something different here (one of mine here is long lines to circle).

Long lines to circle shows up in only 8 dances, but courtesy turning directly into a circle left has 27, including at least one that I really enjoy dancing ([Rod's Grits][]) 


I think a question I'll be wondering throught this search project will be "are these 'pet peeve' figure combinations very different from person to person? Or are there some where we're unanimously wishing for a dance to be a little bit different? The only peeve mentioned I strongly identified with was "too much clockwise turning," which we can't search contradb for _today_, so I'm relying on the reports on the thread.
