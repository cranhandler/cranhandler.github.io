Agricultural engineer, GIS analyst, baker, biker, dancer. I love farms, food, and scientific inquiry. 

Speaker bio:
Growing up on a cranberry farm, Allison Jonjak has always been motivated to understand systems and solve problems. After her master's in Agricultural Engineering focusing on soil pH, Jonjak spent 7 years working with row crop farmers across the US and Canada on precision fertilizer recommendations and agronomic training. Since joining the University of Wisconsin-Madision Division of Extension, she works to keep a tight feedback loop between cranberry growers and researchers. She is based in her native Wisconsin.
